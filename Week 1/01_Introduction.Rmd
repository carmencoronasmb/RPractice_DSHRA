# Computation

A key learning objective in this course is learning/developing skills at writing and reading computer code which is relevant for data analysis. You are not expected to become a software engineer. 

You are expected to be able to read and write high level SCRIPTED code. We use R because it is 

  * an open-source high-level language
  * built for statistical analysis 
  * relatively forgiving for a novice programmer
  * used widely in government, academia, and the private sector
  
There will be a lot of self-learning here. There are many online resources out there. You should consult them. You also have the notes for the course via Github.

# Computation

R is a great tool. Not a panacea. No software is. 

  * Python is better with data scraping and unstructured data like raw text. 
  * Gluon and Keras are better for large-scale ML. 
  * many other examples. 
  
You will have to adapt to the company or preferred software of others. It is good practice to learn to write and read code in one language really well while being flexible and willing to adapt to others.

# Computation

Economists generally work with flat files. Flat files have 2 dimensions: rows and column. We will do the same. 

Be aware that flat files are often not the preferred method for storing and managing data. Large organizations will have structured and unstructured data: 
  1. Structured data 
      + Variables well-defined 
      + Stored in relational database
      + Flat files can be extracted using Structured Query Language (SQL)
      
  2. Unstructured data
      + Variables are not well-defined (Whatsapp messages)
      + Stored over a network of machines, a distributed file system (DFS)
      
R can pull data from both types of systems. Should you spend your time on this? I would say no. Ask your software/data engineers to pull the desired data for you, in the format you want. 

---
# Computation

To read flat files you can use the read.csv command in R:  

```{r}
##I create a folder in my Repository with Data for this week and following ones. 
##I download this csv from Canvas (Files) and run this chunk.

CEO_Diary <- read.csv("/Users/carmencilla/Desktop/Master EUR/Block 2/Data Science and HR Analytics/FEM11213-Coronas/Data/survey_response_data.csv")
```

and then 

```{r}
View(CEO_Diary)

##Investigate some details about the dataset: 
dim(CEO_Diary) ##Dimension: rows x columns
nrow(CEO_Diary) ##Number of rows
ncol(CEO_Diary) ##Number of columns
colnames(CEO_Diary) ##Column names
summary(CEO_Diary) ##Summary of the variables: min/max values, main stats, N/As

```

to see a dataset of time diaries for CEOS:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", out.height= "60%", fig.align='center'}

library(knitr)        # for including graphics
include_graphics("figs/ViewCEODiary.png")

##Image of View function of CEO_Diary dataset. 

```

# Computation

CEO_Diary is called a dataframe. To subset the data you can use 

```{r}
CEO_Diary[1:15,c(1:5,37, 39, 40)]  ##Open the df 15 rows, 8 columns: from 1 to 5, 37, 39, 40: the ones used in the paper!! To build main results. 
```

---

# Computation

To find out the "class" of a variable, you can use the apply function  
```{r}
apply(CEO_Diary,2,class) 
```
 
##More info from ChatGPT in Variable Classes for `apply()`

- **Numeric (`numeric`)**: Continuous or discrete numerical values.
- **Integer (`integer`)**: Whole numbers (`1L`, `2L`).
- **Character (`character`)**: Text or strings.
- **Logical (`logical`)**: Boolean values (`TRUE`, `FALSE`).
- **Factor (`factor`)**: Categorical variables with levels.
- **Date/Time (`Date`, `POSIXct`)**: Dates and timestamps.
- **Complex (`complex`)**: Complex numbers.
- **Matrix/Array (`matrix`, `array`)**: Homogeneous multidimensional structures.
- **Data Frame (`data.frame`)**: Tables with columns of different types.
- **List (`list`)**: Collection of heterogeneous objects.

# Computation

R is "high level" because there are MANY well-designed built-in functions that can be applied to data:   
```{r}
nrow(CEO_Diary) ##Already used. 
```

```{r}
summary(CEO_Diary[1:5]) ##Already used.
```

---

# Computation

Graphical analysis is a strength of R.
```{r}

##Open a figure in png. 
  png(file="figs/CEOTypes.png", width=800, height=300)
  par(mar=c(9, 3 ,1,1))
  barplot(prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type)), las=2)
  dev.off()
```
to produce 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
##I do not have the figure, but learnt the command. 
  knitr::include_graphics("figs/CEOTypes.png")
```

# Computation

What does "barplot(prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type)), las=2)" do? How can you do coding experiments to learn what this function does? 

Go to console and run: 

CEO_Diary <- read.csv("Data/survey_response_data.csv");

barplot(prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type)));

table(CEO_Diary$type);

prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type));

###EXPERIMENT WITH THE CODE SUGGESTED. 
barplot(prop.table(table(CEO_Diary$type))) 
  #Meeting has the highest frequency. 

table(CEO_Diary$type)
  #Output from the table below: 
        business_meal     conference_call               email             meeting

# Computation

Can fit statistical models. For example, can fit regression of Strategy (=1 if meeting about strategy) on 
```{r}
fit <- glm(strategy ~ consultants + politicians, data=CEO_Diary); summary(fit)
  #Results: significant coefficients. 
  #Coefficients would be the following ones: 
    #Strategy = 0.0239291 + 0.0113590*Consultants + -0.0241179*Politicians
```
