# Data Science and HR Analytics: Repository

Each folder presents the corresponding code for each week. Inside every weekly folder, 
it can be found a readme file explaining experiments and replications as a journal. Also,
when some issues have been found while performing the code, they have been noted in these
weekly readme. Folders are structured as follows: 

## Week 1: 
  - 1. Introduction
  - 2. Uncertainty: Bootstrap 
  
## Week 2: 
  - 2. Uncertainty: BH Algorithm
  - 3. Regression
  - 4. Regularization
  
## Week 3: 
  - 5. Classification
  
## Week 4: 
  - 6. Controls 1
  - 6. Controls 2
  
## Data folder: 
It contains all data used and sources used for this practice. 

Note: I had a connection issue with my previous repo (FEM-12113). That is why this new repository has been created.
